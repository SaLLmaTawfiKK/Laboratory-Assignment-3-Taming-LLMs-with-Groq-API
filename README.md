# Laboratory-Assignment-3-Taming-LLMs-with-Groq-API
Developed a sentiment classification tool using the Groq API.
Integrated Groq API for structured text classification.
Tested Basic, Structured, and Few-Shot approaches.
This method provided fast results but lacked justification in its classification responses, making it less interpretable.
The structured approach led to clearer, more logical classifications with slightly improved response time and better interpretability.
This method enhanced classification accuracy and ensured consistency across different inputs.
The model showed inconsistencies across strategies, especially in handling ambiguous sentiment cases, requiring prompt adjustments.
Implementing structured formatting improved classification reliability, and refining the prompts encouraged clearer reasoning from the model.
The project confirmed that structured prompts and few-shot learning techniques significantly influence the model's ability to provide reliable responses.
